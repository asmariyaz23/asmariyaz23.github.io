{"name":"Gene Block Evolution","tagline":"Homepage","body":"Gene blocks are proximal genes in the bacterial genome that operate together. Known special cases of gene blocks are operons, where the genes are typically co-transcribed in a polycistronic mRNA. Several models have been proposed to explain observed patterns of  gene block evolution. However, there is no universal method to describe gene block evolution, which is necessary for a comprehensive examination of the forces affecting this genomic feature. Here we propose such a method that will enable us to examine how gene blocks evolve on a case-by-case basis, and classify their evolutionary parameters.  \r\n \r\nWe propose that the construction and/or destruction of  gene blocks can be described as a sequential series of defined events which include: gene duplication, gene deletion, and gene(s) splitting from the block.  By examining these events we can employ statistical learning to classify evolutionary paths of gene blocks, and connect these paths with biological function.
